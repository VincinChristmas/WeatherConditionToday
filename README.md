<h1 style="text-align: center;">My Weather app</h1>
<img src="weather.png" style="text-align: center;" width: 30%;>
<p style="text-align: center;">this is a app that I made using some basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Flex-box is used for some layout features.</p>


# [This is the free API that I used from open-meteo](https://open-meteo.com/)

# **_More features will be added gradually_**

## The app displays the days of the week from left to right on **_desktop_** and from top to bottom on **_mobile_**

# DESKTOP
<p>the temperature on top is the lowest temperature. The temperature on the bottom is the highest temperature.</p>

<p>the temperature on the left is the lowest temperature. The temperature on the right is the hight temperature.</p>
